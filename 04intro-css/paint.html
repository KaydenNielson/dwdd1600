        <!--Tool Section-->

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>Before you can begin painting, you need the required materials. Here is a list of items to help you get started: </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Hobby knife</li>
            <li>Plastic clippers</li>
            <li>Files or sanding sticks</li>
            <li>Glue (plastic cement or super glue)</li>
            <li>Water cup</li>
            <li>Paper towels</li>
            <li>Brush soap or mild cleaner</li>
            <li>Wet palette or dry palette</li>
            <li>Detail brush (small size)</li>
            <li>Standard brush (medium size)</li>
            <li>Dry brush</li>
            <li>Spray or brush-on primer</li>
            <li>Water-based miniature paints</li>
            <li>Starter sets recommended</li>
            <li>Matte or satin varnish</li>
          </ol>

       <!--Order of Painting-->

          <h2>Order of Operations</h2>
          <p>Begin by breaking your models out of their sprue and assembling them. They should come with instructions on how to do so. Once you've put your models together, clear up any mold lines with your files and hobby knife.</p>
          <p>Clean models in warm, soapy water with a toothbrush and be sure to thoroughly rinse them off after. Doing this removes any release agent applied to the models during the production process. Release agent can prevent primer and paints from adhering to the model.</p>
          <p>Begin by priming your models and letting the primer fully dry. Doing this allows the paint you choose to use to actually adhere to the model. Attempting to paint your models without priming them may result in the paint chipping or not adhering to the model properly.</p>
          <p>Apply your paints.</p>
          <p>Seal these details in with a varnish of your choice. Doing this helps prevent chipping, scratching, and fading from use.</p>
          <p>Decorate the base of your model to bring it all together. You can do this using just about anything you can think of, popular choices are painted sands, model grasses, and pebbles.</p>

        <!--Painting Techniques-->
        
          <h2>Painting Techniques</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>Basecoating</dt>
            <dd>
              Applying the main colors of a model in smooth, solid layers. This establishes the overall color scheme and provides a foundation for all other painting techniques.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Washing (Shading)</dt>
            <dd>
              Applying heavily thinned paint or a premade wash that flows into recesses, creating shadows and depth by darkening creases and fine details.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Dry Brushing</dt>
            <dd>
              Using a brush with very little paint to lightly catch raised surfaces, quickly highlighting textures and edges with minimal effort.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Layering</dt>
            <dd>
              Building up highlights by applying progressively lighter colors in thin layers, adding depth and creating smoother transitions between shadows and highlights.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Edge Highlighting</dt>
            <dd>
              Painting thin lines of lighter color along sharp edges and corners to make details stand out clearly at tabletop viewing distance.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Glazing</dt>
            <dd>
              Applying very thin, transparent layers of paint to subtly shift color, smooth transitions, or enrich tones without obscuring detail.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Contrast / Speed Painting</dt>
            <dd>
              Using specialized paints that flow into recesses while leaving raised areas lighter, allowing models to be painted quickly while still achieving good tabletop contrast.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Wet Blending</dt>
            <dd>
              Blending two or more colors directly on the model while the paint is still wet, creating smooth gradients especially suited for organic or flowing surfaces.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Stippling</dt>
            <dd>
              Applying paint in small dots or dabs with a brush or sponge to create rough or irregular textures such as rust, dirt, or worn surfaces.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Weathering</dt>
            <dd>
              Adding effects that simulate wear, damage, or exposure to the elements, making models appear more realistic and battle-worn.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Object Source Lighting (OSL)</dt>
            <dd>
              Painting the illusion of light emitted from a glowing object onto nearby surfaces, adding dramatic lighting effects and visual storytelling.
            </dd>
          
            <dt>Varnishing</dt>
            <dd>
              Applying a clear protective coat over the finished model to protect the paint from wear and to control the final finish, such as matte, satin, or gloss.
            </dd>
          </dl>
